# Conditional DDPM for CBCT-to-CT Synthesis
This repository contains code developed for a course project focused on generating synthesized CT (sCT) images from CBCT volumes using conditional diffusion models.

The project is based on the Synthrad2025 Challenge (Task 2), and the dataset is retrieved from there. 

The backbone of this implementation is adapted from an existing open-source conditional DDPM repository:

The original code has been modified and extended, including adaption to 3D volumetric data.
